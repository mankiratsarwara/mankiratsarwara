Mankirat

Hi, I code sometimes.

Here's what I know:
- HTML/JavaScript/PHP
- C# (Desktop Development) - Java (Android Development)
- SQL (Oracle, MySQL)
- Google Firebase/Firestore

I suggest looking at my pinned repositories below to see the kinds of application I have built!

Thanks for visiting my profile and have a great day.
